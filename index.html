									<p>I am a born and raised Australian with an English and Croatian background. 
										Throughout my teenage years, I was heavily involved in sports, Swimming was the most dominant sport I participated in and was at my peak of competing at a national level. Unfortunately, due to a constant battle with glandular fever (because of the unhygienic nature of the pool I trained in), I decided to stop competing and swimming altogether.
										My previous education consists of, completing school until year eleven, then moving onto studying certificate three in commercial cookery at my local TAFE institute. I have continued to extend my knowledge throughout my ten-year career in the hospitality industry.
										My interest in IT is based on wanting to find out why things are the way they are. I find it interesting to be able to figure out and learn, whether its a program, game, website, or system be it installing new parts to your PC , looking at code or even certain mechanics and animations within games, I want to know how it all comes together to reach the end result.
										<p>RMIT popped up as an Instagram ad for me as I was scrolling through one day so I decided to look into it more through Open Universities Australia. As I was going through researching the courses that RMIT provides I came across the Bachelor of IT. After looking through the course criteria I noticed that I could do two of the core subjects to be able to study the bachelor, this piqued my interest a lot and I decided within a week to sign up for the next semester. I expect to have gained a better understanding and acquire some new knowledge of IT by the end of this course. I expect to implement this knowledge towards what I want to study full-time and the job I wish to have in the near future.
										<p>My enthusiasm piqued for IT as a child when my dad brought home our first family computer, he explained that sending an email to another country would take as long as it took to dial the phone, I was immediately interested as to how that would work and needed to know more. For some reason unbeknown to me I was not allowed to spend too much time if any, on the computer due to my mother just outright saying NO. 
										This then made using computers or gaming consoles somewhat taboo throughout my childhood, that is until I was old enough to get a job and buy a computer and gaming consoles. 
										I have been exploring the abilities of IT systems ever since, mostly by watching Youtube videos of other people using their IT knowledge for a humorous outcome, whether it be people playing video games or using robotics and computer components to create outrageous or even useless inventions, if it had a funny side to it I found it easier to understand and follow than just a regular tutorial.
										I have never really delved into any sort of system or program with fears of doing something wrong and having it not work anymore (I once tried to install a new SSD into my PC and got blue screened), therefore I have decided to improve on my knowledge by taking on the bachelor of IT and making IT become a bigger part of my life by working with it and learning about it every day.
